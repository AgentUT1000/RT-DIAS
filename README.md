# Real-Time Disaster Information Aggregation Software
Submission for the Online round of SSH'26 by O(1).


RT-DIAS is an event-driven microservices platform that transforms chaotic social media noise into actionable disaster intelligence for emergency response teams. By leveraging computer vision, multilingual NLP, and real-time geospatial analysis, we convert the visual and vernacular web into lifesaving signals for organizations like India's NDRF (National Disaster Response Force).

The Problem: In disaster scenarios, critical hours are lost due to bureaucratic reporting bottlenecks. Social media contains ground-truth evidence, but it's buried in terabytes of unstructured data across multiple languages and formats.
Our Solution: Real-time aggregation, AI-powered verification, and intelligent routing of disaster intelligence from Instagram, GDELT, and other OSINT sources.
